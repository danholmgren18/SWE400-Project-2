# Project1SWE400 - Team Huo No

PLAN & HW2 BY FRIDAY

Merlin's Notes:
- more detail, the better
- ** know our plan for exceptions
- make a list of requirements for code (method A that does x)
- a strategy for how to test everything (no user interface, JUNIT test only way to test)

**Responsibilities**

*Single Table Classes and Who*
*  Connections/Runner 
*  ChemicalRowDataGateway & test class
*  ChemicalTableDataGateway & test class
*  DTO


 -- First Database  (GOAL: )
 - Class Diagram (figure out the methods)
 - 
 

 -- Second Database (TBA Goal: )
    - TBA after working with first Database 
    

 --Third Database (TBA Goal: h)
    - TBA after working with first Database

**Game Plan**
1.  Database connection
2.  Create method, insert method, delete method, select method, update method
3.  JUNIT Tests for above
4.  Create tables
5.  Row Data Gateway Class
6.  Table Data Gateway Class
7.  Main method to instantiate gateways where we want them in the DB
8.  Rinse and Repeat for other two databases (with fun twists for each pattern)
