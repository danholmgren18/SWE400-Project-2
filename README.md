# Project1SWE400 - Team Huo No

Merlin's Notes:
- more detail, the better
- ** know our plan for exceptions
- make a list of requirements for code (method A that does x)
- a strategy for how to test everything (no user interface, JUNIT test only way to test)



**Responsibilities**
 -- First Database  (GOAL: Done by Friday 11th)
 - Code for Connecting to the data base
 - Code to Create the tables
 - Write SQL statements (a method for insert and for delete)
 - JUNIT tests (one/more for each table and exceptions, for Create, for Insert, for Delete, )
 - Gateways (will wrap the five methods below)
    - Create table
    - Insert
    - Delete
    - Update
    - Select

 -- Second Database (TBA Goal: Tuesday 15th)
    - TBA after working with first Database 
    

 --Third Database (TBA Goal: Friday 18th)
    - TBA after working with first Database

**Game Plan**
1.  Database connection
2.  Create method, insert method, delete method, select method, update method
3.  JUNIT Tests for above
4.  Create tables
5.  Row Data Gateway Class
6.  Table Data Gateway Class
7.  Main method to instantiate gateways where we want them in the DB
8.  Rinse and Repeat for other two databases (with fun twists for each pattern)
